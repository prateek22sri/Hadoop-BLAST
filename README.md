# HadoopBlast - Cloud Computing Project 3

By this point you should have gone over the sections concerning Hadoop Setup and a few Hadoop programs.
Now you are going to blend these applications by implementing a parallel version of BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using the programming interfaces
of the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Note that this application is written in ”Map-Only” fashion, which
means no reduce code is necessary
